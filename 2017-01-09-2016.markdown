Last September I left [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), f.k.a. Hacker School.
Three and a half wonderful years there shaped me as programmer, an educator,
a contributing community member and above all as a learner.

There's so much to say about the Recurse Center that I have trouble saying anything at all.

Mary Rose Cook [wrote about leaving](https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/ive-left-the-recurse-center)
a few months later. Like Mary, I believe I did the best work of my life at the Recurse Center.

Allison Kaptur [wrote about leaving](http://akaptur.com/blog/2014/10/10/im-joining-dropbox/) the previous year and
[gave a keynote](http://akaptur.com/blog/2015/10/10/effective-learning-strategies-for-programmers/)
about learning strategies for programmers which draws on her experience at the Recurse Center.

Right after I left I hung out in Montana at a lake that anyone I've helped
write a BitTorrent client
[will](https://github.com/search?q=flagfromserver&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93)
[recognize](assets/flag.jpg).

While I was there I went for runs, played through Chrono Trigger, and started writing some Haskell.

Before fall 2015 I had worked or been in school without more than a couple weeks off at a time for eleven years: summer jobs through college, an internship after graduating, writing software at a neuroimaging lab, attending RC and then 2 days later showing up to help review applications for the next batch.
I enjoyed it tremendously and was incredibly fortunate to always have work lined up.
Now I'm also incredibly fortunate to have been able to take so much time off.

After my Montana trip I moved to Boston. I hung out at coffee
shops and grassy areas and unlocked rooms at MIT. Which brings us up to 2016.

#Travel

![](/assets/tripphotos/01.jpg)

I explored Western Europe for a couple months with my sister Lauren, including a week-long hike along Hadrian's Wall.

I also made it to the Dominican Republic for PyCarribean, Vancouver for
ConFoo, Portland for PyCon, Eugene to watch the Olympic Trials with old family track friends,
and San Diego.

In September I moved to New York, and in the last couple months I've spent a lot of time in the Bay Area for interviews.

#Projects

<video src="/assets/rewindlines.mp4" autoplay="true" loop="true" controls></video>

I used mostly front-end languages, a change for me; and implemented toy
programming languages, less of a change.

I prototyped several projects, and wrapped one of them up enough to call it
done: [Dal Segno](http://dalsegno.ballingt.com/)
is an interactive programming enviroment similar to
[Mary's Code Lauren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOGuPJ6aFzE)
but with some different design goals.

As I experimented with creating [a programming
game](https://github.com/thomasballinger/shiplang), I published a
few prototypes: [early gameplay](http://jan14prototype.ballingt.com/),
[with programming interface](http://march8prototype.ballingt.com/?simulator),
[better graphics](http://missilecmd.ballingt.com/).

I wrote a series of blog posts leading up to finally writing about
[rlundo](https://github.com/thomasballinger/rlundo#rlundo),
a sweet hack you should check out. The posts were about [CLIs vs
TUIs](rich-terminal-applications), [fancy CLI
features](rich-terminal-applications-2), and [undo in interactive
interpreters](/interactive-interpreter-undo). The last one is pretty long
and, I think, pretty fun. It includes some Buster
Keaton-style expressions from me on video.

I played with Elm for a bit, making an [audio
editor](http://remixcast.com/editor/) and a
[game](http://love.ballingt.com/) with some [interesting background
music](http://love.ballingt.com/music.html). I found working with Elm
really helpful for grokking react + redux. I also found it helpful for getting
more comfortable with the basics of Haskell.

I got excited about remixing podcasts and created a file format and two UI
prototypes but didn't do much else with the idea.

I continued to help maintain [bpython](https://github.com/bpython/bpython).

#Talks

![](/assets/newnewtalkplanning.jpg)

I gave [a talk about closures](http://ballingt.com/python-closures)
at PyCon this year, and
it was the first talk I've given that I think
comes close to living up to the talks
[Ned Batchelder](http://pyvideo.org/speaker/ned-batchelder.html) gives.

At ConFoo and at MongoDB in NYC I gave talks about undo.

At Hack&&Tell I gave some in-progress interactive programming environment
talks I really enjoyed.

I presented an introduction to network programming in Python for members of the
Boston Python Users Group.

#Other

![](/assets/tripphotos/newnew08.jpg)

I ate this sandwich in London which had applesauce on it, it was really good.

I became a certified Software Carpentry instructor this year.
Interactively teaching many dozens of students continues to be something
I'm interested in but find much more difficult that the one on one
interactions I have much more practice with.

LIGO found gravitational waves this year! I didn't do anything to help with
this this year, but I did a long time ago.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">re today&#39;s LIGO gravitational wave discovery: I wrote some code for LIGO! <a href="https://t.co/XwOhLuHrkY">https://t.co/XwOhLuHrkY</a> <a href="https://t.co/UV4NXNAYRZ">pic.twitter.com/UV4NXNAYRZ</a></p>&mdash; Tom  üëÄüèö in SF (@ballingt) <a href="https://twitter.com/ballingt/status/697807371498889216">February 11, 2016</a></blockquote>

This fall I started interviewing with companies. It was interesting to finally
see firsthand what interviews were like. I spent a lot of time at the Recurse
Center helping RCers prepare for interviews if interviewing was something that
there were nervous about. Sometimes I debriefed them after interviews to assess
the value of this preparation, but actually being present was much better.

Over three trips out west (many thanks to very patient and hospitable friends
for housing me), the most fun interview by far was working with Amjad and Haya of
[repl.it](repl.it). I spent three days with them helping implement
a [Python debugger](https://repl.it/site/blog/python-debugger) for their
online REPL/IDE product. At every company at which I interviewed, I was impressed
with my interviewers and the teams I was applying to join.

#This Year

Today I start work at Dropbox.

Dropbox has been on my radar as a neat place to work since I first attended PyCon in 2011.
I considered applying at the end of my Recurse Center batch in 2012,
but stayed on to have a life-changing experience working there.
My interest increased when, through Dropbox's
acquisition of Zulip in 2014,
several people I thought the world of joined Dropbox.

I have a terrific amount to learn in order to become competent and productive
at Dropbox, so doing that learning is a priority for me right now.

I'd like to learn some web design this year, styling a webpage is like
pulling teeth. Oh, and I'll have a dental plan, so finally going to make
some dentist appointments.

I'm excited to be back on the West Coast.

I have a lot to learn about living in the Bay Area.
Apparently stores close at 9 or 10pm.
Jaywalking is like having a superpower here, no one else seems to do it.
